TODO: 
Work on putting all the data into a shp file or GeoJson
file so that we can use it in the map. Find a fast way 
to do that if we want to quickly add more data later.
I have some ideas, so ask me if you need help.

Impliment Solutions for:
-swapping between data sets and display types.
-for displaying a graphs based on the data
-displaying a bubble when hovering over a country with its name and data
-cross highlighting between the graph and the map.
-Timeline for stepping through months of data and data types.
-Drop down menu's in general.

Priority:
-Data Structure,
-Graphing,
-Timeline,
-Flow Lines,
-Everything else should be easy once these are in place.
